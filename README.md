# Advent of Code

Here's where I save my solutions to the problems each year. I have different goals for each year.

## 2022

The goal for this year is to get as far as possible with different languages. If something gets too hard, I will resort to using python, but I will try using C or Haskell in the first place to have some fun with languages I don't know!

The goal for this year was to get as far as possible using any language.
